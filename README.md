# hello-world
My first repository

Well I am brand new to github and programming, I have been taking a c++ class for a weeks now and am learning some basic concepts. While I do find interest in programming, I have to admit that it is pretty challenging.  Sometimes it is frustrating, but overall it is rewarding, stimulating, and pretty fun. I am interested in honing in my skills so that I can get to a point in which I can earn an internship of some kind. I would like to make a career out of programming and feel that github is a must have in order to branch out, build an accessible portfolio, and learn. 

Please contact me for any input, advice, and/or suggestions. 

Thanks, 

Ninja J.
